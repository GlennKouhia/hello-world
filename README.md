# hello-world
This is the ReadMe document for this project.
I'm creating the project as the first step in a multi-step process to build a site that's hosted in the cloud and delivers some basic functionality to the user. In fact, I'm writing this ReadMe document to brush-up my Git skills.
Thanks for viewing this project and reading this document.
Cheers!
